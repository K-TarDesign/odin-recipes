        <p>This is a turkey recipe I modified from one I found online.
        I replaced the kidney beans with black beans and the chicken broth 
        with chicken bone broth and added sweet potatos, which creates a 
        very thick and flavorful base. Additionally, I will add other 
        vegetables to the recipe, such as corn and cabbage.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <UL>
            <li>Canola oil</li>
            <li>1 medium yellow onion</li>
            <li>1 medium bell pepper</li>
            <li>3 cloves of garlic </li>
            <li>1 lb of ground turkey or chicken</li>
            <li>1 can of black beans</li>
            <li>1 can of diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>Bone broth</li>
            <li>Misc. Spices</li>
            <li>1 sweet potato, cubed</li>
            <li>Whatever other veggies you wanna add</li>
            <li>Salt & pepper</li>
        </UL>

        <br>
        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Saute the onions & peppers in oil for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic & turkey. Saute until turkey is brown.</li>
            <li>Add the beans, tomatoes, bone broth, misc. spices. Mix together and 
                bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Add the sweet potato and any other veggies you want.</li>
            <li>Add salt & pepper to the recipe any time during the cooking process.</li>
            <li>Let the chili simmer with a lid slightly ajar.</li>
            <li>You can remove it from the heat or not, after that. It doesn't really 
                matter. The longer it cooks, the softer the more the sweet potatoes break down.</li>
        </ol>
